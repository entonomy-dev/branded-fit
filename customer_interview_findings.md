## Branded Fit - Customer Discovery Research Results

**Document Owner:** Head of Sales & Customer Development
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Completed

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents findings from five in-depth customer discovery interviews conducted with marketing managers and operations personnel at small professional services firms (10-50 employees). The interviews validate our core hypothesis that **branded merchandise procurement is a time-consuming, fragmented, and frustrating process** for small businesses without dedicated procurement resources.

### Key Findings at a Glance

**Pain Point Validation:** ✅ **100% of interviewees** confirmed that managing branded apparel is significantly time-consuming and frustrating

**Time Investment:** Marketing managers spend an average of **6-12 hours per project** on branded merchandise procurement, ranging from initial vendor research to final distribution

**Annual Frequency:** Companies order branded items **2-4 times per year** on average, with higher frequency during hiring surges or major events

**Budget Ranges:** Annual spending on branded merchandise ranges from **$3,000 to $15,000**, with most falling in the $5,000-$8,000 range

**Primary Pain Points (ranked by frequency):**
1. **Time-consuming vendor research and coordination** (5/5 interviewees)

**Competitive Landscape:** Interviewees currently use **Custom Ink (3/5), VistaPrint (2/5), Printful (1/5), and local print shops (2/5)**, often juggling multiple vendors per project

### Strategic Implications

1. **Beachhead Market Confirmed:** Small professional services firms (law, accounting, consulting) with 25-50 employees represent an ideal initial target
2. **Core Value Proposition:** Time savings and streamlined workflow are more valuable than cost savings alone
3. **Critical Features:** AI-powered logo design, integrated size collection, quality consistency guarantees, and fast turnaround are must-haves
4. **Pricing Model:** Monthly subscription ($200-$400) is preferred over per-order fees, with transparency around product markups
5. **Go-to-Market Strategy:** LinkedIn outreach, referrals from satisfied customers, and content marketing about "hidden costs of DIY swag management"

## Interview 1: Sarah Chen - Marketing Manager at MidTier Consulting

### Company Profile
- **Company:** MidTier Consulting Group
- **Size:** 35 employees
- **Industry:** Management consulting (HR and organizational development focus)
- **Location:** Austin, TX
- **Interviewee Role:** Marketing Manager (4 years in role)

### Background and Context

Sarah manages all marketing activities for MidTier Consulting, including digital marketing, content creation, event planning, and branded merchandise. The company has grown from 18 to 35 employees over the past three years, creating increased demand for branded items for new hire welcome kits, client gifts, and conference swag.

**Current Merchandise Frequency:** 3-4 times per year
- New hire welcome kits (ongoing, batched quarterly)
- Annual company retreat apparel (once per year)
- Conference/trade show materials (1-2 times per year)
- Client appreciation gifts (holiday season)

**Annual Budget:** Approximately $8,000, pulled from general marketing budget

### Current Process and Workflow

Sarah walked us through her most recent branded apparel order - t-shirts and hoodies for their annual company retreat in January 2026:

**Step 1: Research and Vendor Selection (3-4 hours)**
> "I started by Googling 'custom company hoodies' and ended up with like 15 tabs open. I looked at Custom Ink, Printful, VistaPrint, and a few local Austin print shops. Each one had different pricing structures, minimum order quantities, and turnaround times. It was overwhelming."

**Step 2: Design Coordination (4-5 hours)**
> "We don't have an in-house designer, so I used Canva to mock up a logo placement, but I'm not confident in my design skills. I went back and forth with the Custom Ink design team like six times getting the colors right. Our brand colors are very specific, and they kept coming back slightly off."

**Step 3: Size Collection (2-3 hours)**
> "This is always the worst part. I created a Google Form to collect everyone's sizes, but people are slow to respond. I had to send three reminder emails and still had to Slack people individually. Then someone inevitably says 'I'm between sizes' and asks for advice, which I have no idea how to answer."

**Step 4: Order Placement and Approval (1 hour)**
> "Getting budget approval is pretty straightforward since it's an annual event and planned for, but coordinating the final order was stressful. I had to create a detailed spreadsheet matching names to sizes to quantities, triple-check everything, and then submit."

**Step 5: Waiting and Follow-up (ongoing anxiety)**
> "Custom Ink said 10 business days, but it ended up being 14. I was checking the tracking constantly because our retreat was on a specific date. If it had been late, we wouldn't have had apparel for the event. That stress isn't worth it."

**Step 6: Distribution (1-2 hours)**
> "Everything shipped to our office in one big box. I had to sort through 35 t-shirts and 30 hoodies, match them to people's names, and distribute them. A few people were remote, so I had to arrange separate shipments to them, which was an additional headache."

**Total Time Investment:** 12-15 hours for a single order

**Total Cost:** $2,200 for apparel + ~$450 in Sarah's time (at $30/hour opportunity cost)

### Primary Pain Points

#### 1. Overwhelming Vendor Research
> "There are so many options, and they all look the same on the surface. I have no idea how to evaluate quality without ordering samples, which adds more time and cost. I wish someone would just tell me: here are three vetted vendors, here's what makes them different, pick one."

**Intensity Score:** 8/10

#### 2. Design Quality Anxiety
> "I'm not a designer. I can put a logo on a t-shirt in Canva, but I don't know if it looks professional. Every time I place an order, I worry that when it arrives, it'll look cheap or the logo will be fuzzy. We're a professional consulting firm - our brand matters."

**Intensity Score:** 9/10

#### 3. Size Collection Nightmare
> "Collecting sizes is like herding cats. People don't respond to emails, they ask for sizing advice I can't give, and there's always someone who needs a size exchange after the fact. If I could automate that entire process, I would in a heartbeat."

**Intensity Score:** 7/10

#### 4. Turnaround Time Pressure
> "The timelines are always tighter than I'd like. If I need something in three weeks, that means I need to have everything finalized and ordered in less than two weeks to account for production and shipping. Rush orders cost a fortune, so I'm constantly stressed about timelines."

**Intensity Score:** 8/10

### Current Solutions and Workarounds

**Primary Vendor:** Custom Ink
- **Pros:** User-friendly interface, responsive design team, decent quality
- **Cons:** No design originality, slow turnaround, size collection still manual

**Backup Vendor:** Local Austin print shop (used once for rush order)
- **Pros:** Fast turnaround for emergencies, in-person consultation
- **Cons:** More expensive, limited product selection, inconsistent quality

**Design Support:** Canva for mockups, Custom Ink design team for refinements
- **Gap:** No professional logo design support within the platform

### Concept Testing: Reaction to Branded Fit

When presented with the Branded Fit concept (AI-powered logo generation, automated storefront, employee size self-selection):

**Initial Reaction:**
> "Oh my God, yes. If this could eliminate the size collection spreadsheet alone, I'd use it. But the AI logo thing is really interesting - I'd be curious to see how good the designs are. If they're actually professional quality, that would solve a huge problem for me."

**Likelihood to Try:** 9/10

**Most Appealing Features:**
1. Automated size collection and employee portal
2. AI-powered logo design
3. Curated product selection (no decision fatigue)

**Concerns:**
> "My biggest question is quality. I've been burned by 'automated' solutions before that promise the world and deliver mediocrity. I'd need to see samples or have some kind of quality guarantee. Also, pricing needs to be transparent - I hate hidden fees or surprise upcharges."

### Willingness to Pay

**Pricing Sensitivity:**
- **Monthly subscription:** Would pay **$250-$300/month** for unlimited orders and design support
- **Per-order model:** Would accept **10-15% markup** on products if it included all design and coordination services
- **Value justification:** "If this saves me 10 hours per order and I do 4 orders a year, that's 40 hours - basically a full work week. That's easily worth $1,000-$1,200 annually, maybe more."

**Purchase Decision Process:**
- **Decision maker:** Sarah has approval authority up to $5,000 annually; anything higher requires COO approval
- **Evaluation criteria:** Quality samples, transparent pricing, customer testimonials, trial period
- **Timeline:** Would evaluate in Q2 2026 for implementation before annual retreat planning in Q3

### Key Quotes for Marketing

> "Managing branded merchandise feels like a second job I didn't sign up for. It's not strategic, it's not creative - it's just time-consuming admin work."

> "Every time I order company swag, I'm secretly terrified it'll show up looking cheap and reflect poorly on our brand."

> "If someone could wave a magic wand and make the size collection process disappear, I'd pay good money for that wand."

### Follow-up Opportunities

- **Beta testing interest:** ✅ Yes, very interested
- **Referrals provided:** 2 contacts (marketing manager at another Austin consulting firm, operations manager at tech company)
- **Follow-up permission:** ✅ Yes, happy to provide feedback on prototypes

## Interview 2: Michael Rodriguez - Operations Manager at Hartwell & Associates Law Firm

### Company Profile
- **Company:** Hartwell & Associates
- **Size:** 28 employees (18 attorneys, 10 support staff)
- **Industry:** Legal services (employment law and corporate litigation)
- **Location:** Denver, CO
- **Interviewee Role:** Operations Manager (3 years in role)

### Background and Context

Michael handles all non-legal operations for Hartwell & Associates, including office management, HR coordination, IT procurement, and event planning. Branded merchandise falls under his purview, though it's not officially in his job description. The firm has a traditional culture but is working to modernize its brand and employee experience to compete for younger legal talent.

**Current Merchandise Frequency:** 2-3 times per year
- New attorney welcome gifts (ongoing, ordered as needed)
- Firm anniversary celebration (annual event)
- Client appreciation gifts (sporadic)

**Annual Budget:** Approximately $6,500, split between operations and marketing budgets

### Current Process and Workflow

Michael described his most recent project - custom leather portfolios with embossed firm logo for client gifts in December 2025:

**Step 1: Product Research (5-6 hours)**
> "I wasn't even sure where to start with custom leather goods. I called our previous vendor for t-shirts, but they don't do leather. I ended up finding a promotional products distributor through a Google search, but their website was outdated and confusing. I had to call them to figure out options."

**Step 2: Logo Vectorization Challenge (3 hours)**
> "This was a nightmare. Our firm's logo was created years ago, and we only had a low-resolution JPG. The vendor said they needed a vector file (EPS or AI format), which I didn't have. I had to hire a freelancer on Fiverr for $50 to recreate our logo as a vector. That added time and cost I wasn't expecting."

**Step 3: Sample Review and Approval (2 weeks)**
> "The vendor insisted we order a sample before the full run, which makes sense but added two weeks to the timeline. When the sample arrived, the managing partner wasn't happy with the logo placement. We had to revise and order another sample. That was another two weeks and another $35."

**Step 4: Final Order and Production (3 weeks)**
> "Once we approved the sample, production took three weeks. I was constantly emailing for updates because there was no online tracking. It felt like shouting into a void."

**Total Time Investment:** 8-10 hours of active work + 5+ weeks of waiting

**Total Cost:** $1,800 for portfolios + $85 for samples and logo work + Michael's time

### Primary Pain Points

#### 1. Vendor Discovery and Evaluation
> "There's no Yelp for promotional products vendors. I had no idea if I was getting ripped off or if the quality would be good. I just had to trust this random company I found on Google and hope for the best."

**Intensity Score:** 9/10

#### 2. Logo File Format Issues
> "I didn't even know what a vector file was before this project. Why is this so complicated? I just want our logo on a product. Having to hire someone just to convert a file format felt absurd."

**Intensity Score:** 8/10

#### 3. Lack of Real-Time Visibility
> "Once I placed the order, I had zero visibility into production status. I was emailing the vendor every few days asking 'Where are we at?' and getting vague responses like 'It's in production.' I manage a law firm - I'm used to clear timelines and accountability."

**Intensity Score:** 7/10

#### 4. Quality Uncertainty Until Delivery
> "The sample process helps, but it adds weeks and cost. And even then, I'm trusting that the full order will match the sample. There's always that anxiety that a bulk order will have quality issues that weren't in the sample."

**Intensity Score:** 7/10

### Current Solutions and Workarounds

**Primary Vendor:** Promotional products distributor (company name: PromoPros)
- **Pros:** Wide product selection, willing to do custom work
- **Cons:** Outdated technology, poor communication, opaque pricing

**T-shirt/Apparel Vendor:** VistaPrint
- **Pros:** Fast, cheap, easy online ordering
- **Cons:** Generic designs, mediocre quality, limited customization

**Logo Design:** Hired external freelancer on Fiverr
- **Gap:** No ongoing design support or brand asset management

### Concept Testing: Reaction to Branded Fit

When presented with the Branded Fit concept:

**Initial Reaction:**
> "This would have saved me weeks of headache on my last project. The fact that I can upload a logo in any format and your AI can clean it up or generate alternatives? That alone is worth paying for. And if everything is online with real-time tracking, that's a game-changer for someone like me who's juggling ten other priorities."

**Likelihood to Try:** 8/10

**Most Appealing Features:**
1. Logo optimization and AI-powered design alternatives
2. Real-time order tracking and production visibility
3. Curated, quality-vetted product selection
4. Customer service with SLA commitments

**Concerns:**
> "My concern is whether this works for non-apparel items. We order a lot of client gifts - leather goods, premium drinkware, custom notebooks. If Branded Fit is just t-shirts and hoodies, that's only part of my problem. I need a one-stop solution for all branded merchandise."

### Willingness to Pay

**Pricing Sensitivity:**
- **Monthly subscription:** Would pay **$150-$200/month** for design tools and platform access
- **Per-order model:** Would accept **12-18% markup** on products for white-glove service and quality guarantees
- **Value justification:** "Time is money in a law firm. If this saves our attorneys from having to weigh in on logo placement and samples, that's billable hours saved. Easily worth a few hundred dollars a month."

**Purchase Decision Process:**
- **Decision maker:** Michael has autonomy for operational tools under $3,000 annually; managing partner approval required for larger commitments
- **Evaluation criteria:** Product quality samples, transparent pricing, customer references from other law firms, contract flexibility
- **Timeline:** Would consider for Q2 2026 implementation, with first use case being summer associate welcome gifts

### Key Quotes for Marketing

> "I'm an operations guy, not a designer. I need tools that do the thinking for me so I can focus on running the firm."

> "The worst part of ordering branded merchandise is the black box. I place an order and just have to pray it shows up on time and looks good."

> "If you can promise me that I'll never have to hire a Fiverr freelancer to vectorize a logo again, you've got my business."

### Follow-up Opportunities

- **Beta testing interest:** ✅ Yes, interested (would want to test with low-stakes order first)
- **Referrals provided:** 1 contact (operations manager at another Denver law firm)
- **Follow-up permission:** ✅ Yes, open to continued conversation

## Interview 3: Jennifer Patel - Marketing Director at Greenfield Accounting Partners

### Company Profile
- **Company:** Greenfield Accounting Partners
- **Size:** 42 employees
- **Industry:** Accounting and tax services
- **Location:** Chicago, IL
- **Interviewee Role:** Marketing Director (6 years in role)

### Background and Context

Jennifer is the sole marketing person at Greenfield Accounting, managing website, content marketing, event sponsorships, and all branded materials. As the firm has grown, the volume of branded merchandise requests has increased significantly. Jennifer is highly organized and process-oriented, which makes the fragmented nature of merchandise procurement particularly frustrating for her.

**Current Merchandise Frequency:** 4-5 times per year
- New hire welcome kits (quarterly batches)
- Tax season team appreciation gifts (annual)
- Community event sponsorship materials (2-3 times per year)
- Holiday client gifts (annual)

**Annual Budget:** Approximately $12,000 (largest of our interviewees)

### Current Process and Workflow

Jennifer described her systematic but time-intensive approach to a recent order - welcome kits for five new hires in Q4 2025:

**Step 1: Product Curation (2-3 hours)**
> "I've gotten better at this over time, but it still takes hours. I maintain a spreadsheet of products I've used before, vendors, pricing, and quality ratings. For welcome kits, I wanted branded t-shirts, water bottles, notebooks, and stickers. That's four different potential vendors."

**Step 2: Multi-Vendor Coordination (6-8 hours)**
> "This is where it gets messy. I ordered t-shirts from Custom Ink, water bottles from a promotional products company, notebooks from Moo, and stickers from StickerMule. Each vendor has a different ordering process, different design specs, and different turnaround times. I basically had to project manage four separate timelines."

**Step 3: Design Consistency Challenge (3-4 hours)**
> "I had to adapt our logo for each vendor's specifications. Custom Ink wanted RGB, the promo company wanted CMYK, Moo had specific DPI requirements. I spent hours in Photoshop making sure the colors matched across all items. And they still didn't match perfectly when they arrived."

**Step 4: Shipping Coordination (2 hours + ongoing stress)**
> "Everything shipped separately. T-shirts arrived on Monday, water bottles on Wednesday, notebooks on Friday, and stickers were delayed by a week. I had to wait until everything arrived before I could assemble the welcome kits. If I'd had a hard deadline, I would have been in trouble."

**Step 5: Assembly and Distribution (3 hours)**
> "Once everything finally arrived, I spent half a day assembling kits, adding welcome letters, and packaging everything. Then I had to coordinate with our office manager to distribute to employees, some of whom are remote."

**Total Time Investment:** 16-18 hours spread over 3 weeks

**Total Cost:** $1,400 for products + significant time investment + stress

### Primary Pain Points

#### 1. Multi-Vendor Management Complexity
> "Juggling four different vendors for one project is exhausting. Four different accounts, four different design uploads, four different production timelines, four different shipping notifications. It's like having four part-time jobs just to give someone a welcome kit."

**Intensity Score:** 10/10 (highest pain point across all interviews)

#### 2. Brand Consistency Across Vendors
> "Our brand colors are Pantone 541 and Pantone 7690. Try getting those colors to match across Custom Ink, a promotional products distributor, and Moo. It's basically impossible. The welcome kits look fine, but a trained eye can see the color variations, and it bothers me."

**Intensity Score:** 8/10

#### 3. Lack of Centralized Purchasing History
> "I have a spreadsheet, but it's not a real system. I can't easily see what I ordered last year, who I ordered from, what the quality was like, or what sizes people preferred. Every new order feels like starting from scratch."

**Intensity Score:** 6/10

#### 4. No Economies of Scale
> "Because I'm spreading orders across multiple vendors, I never hit volume discounts. If I could consolidate everything with one vendor, I'd probably save 15-20% through better pricing tiers and reduced shipping costs."

**Intensity Score:** 7/10

### Current Solutions and Workarounds

**Primary Vendors:** Custom Ink (apparel), generic promotional products distributor (drinkware/accessories), Moo (print items), StickerMule (stickers)

**Design Management:** Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator) for logo adaptation

**Project Tracking:** Personal spreadsheet to track vendors, orders, costs, and timelines

**Gap:** No unified platform that handles multiple product categories with consistent branding

### Concept Testing: Reaction to Branded Fit

When presented with the Branded Fit concept:

**Initial Reaction:**
> "You're describing exactly what I've been wishing existed for three years. A single platform where I can order everything - apparel, drinkware, accessories, print items - with guaranteed brand consistency? And AI-generated design options? That's literally my dream tool. When can I start using this?"

**Likelihood to Try:** 10/10

**Most Appealing Features:**
1. Unified platform for all product categories (no more vendor juggling)
2. Brand consistency guarantees across all items
3. Purchase history and reordering capabilities
4. AI-powered design generation for new products

**Concerns:**
> "My only concern is product selection. If you're curating items, I need to make sure you have the quality level we expect. We're not a tech startup that can get away with cheap swag - we're a professional services firm. Quality matters more than price."

### Willingness to Pay

**Pricing Sensitivity:**
- **Monthly subscription:** Would pay **$300-$400/month** for platform access, unlimited design support, and order management tools
- **Per-order model:** Would accept **10-12% markup** on products for consolidated vendor management
- **Value justification:** "I spend 60-80 hours a year on merchandise management. If this cuts that in half, it's worth $3,000-$4,000 annually just in my time savings. Add in better pricing from consolidation, and it basically pays for itself."

**Purchase Decision Process:**
- **Decision maker:** Jennifer has full authority over marketing budget and vendor selection
- **Evaluation criteria:** Product samples across multiple categories, proof of brand color consistency, customer testimonials, 30-day trial period
- **Timeline:** Ready to evaluate immediately; could implement in Q1 2026 for use in Q2 new hire season

### Key Quotes for Marketing

> "Managing multiple vendors for a single project is like conducting an orchestra where none of the musicians can see you. It's chaos."

> "I have literal nightmares about welcome kits arriving with mismatched logos. That's not an exaggeration."

> "If you can solve the multi-vendor coordination problem, you've solved 80% of my branded merchandise headaches."

### Follow-up Opportunities

- **Beta testing interest:** ✅ Yes, extremely interested (first to volunteer)
- **Referrals provided:** 3 contacts (marketing contacts at other Chicago professional services firms)
- **Testimonial opportunity:** Would provide testimonial and case study if product delivers on promise
- **Follow-up permission:** ✅ Yes, eager for updates on product development

## Interview 4: David Kim - Office Manager at Skyline Architecture Studio

### Company Profile
- **Company:** Skyline Architecture Studio
- **Size:** 22 employees
- **Industry:** Architecture and interior design
- **Location:** Portland, OR
- **Interviewee Role:** Office Manager (2 years in role)

### Background and Context

David is relatively new to office management, having transitioned from an administrative assistant role two years ago. He handles facilities, office supplies, event coordination, and branded merchandise as part of his broader responsibilities. Skyline Architecture has a strong visual brand identity, which makes design quality particularly important for any branded materials.

**Current Merchandise Frequency:** 2-3 times per year
- New employee welcome gifts (as needed)
- Annual firm celebration apparel
- Client gifts for major project completions

**Annual Budget:** Approximately $4,000 (modest budget for smaller firm)

### Current Process and Workflow

David shared his experience ordering t-shirts for Skyline's 10-year anniversary celebration in Fall 2025:

**Step 1: Pinterest-Level Expectations (browsing: 2-3 hours)**
> "We're an architecture firm, so everyone here has opinions about design. I spent hours looking at examples online - Pinterest, Instagram, design blogs - trying to find inspiration for a t-shirt that would meet our firm's aesthetic standards. That's before I even started looking for vendors."

**Step 2: Design Development Mismatch (4-5 hours + $200)**
> "I reached out to Custom Ink and showed them examples of what we wanted - minimalist, modern, high-quality look. Their design team was nice but clearly focused on volume, not custom artistry. The mockups they sent looked generic. I ended up hiring a freelance designer we've worked with before to create a proper design file, which cost $200 and took a week."

**Step 3: Quality Anxiety and Sample Orders (1 week + $45)**
> "After the design disaster, I was paranoid about quality. I ordered sample t-shirts from three different vendors - Custom Ink, Printful, and a local Portland print shop. I wanted to feel the fabric, see the print quality in person. The samples were all over the map in terms of quality and fit."

**Step 4: Final Decision and Ordering (2-3 hours)**
> "After everyone weighed in on the samples - and yes, I had to circulate physical samples around the office for opinions - we went with the local print shop. They were the most expensive but had the best quality. Ordering was straightforward, but their online system was clunky."

**Step 5: Distribution and Leftovers (1 hour + storage issues)**
> "I ordered extras 'just in case,' which was smart because two people wanted different sizes. But now I have a box of 8 extra t-shirts in our storage closet that will probably never get used. That's like $150 sitting there."

**Total Time Investment:** 10-12 hours + 2 weeks waiting for design/samples

**Total Cost:** $850 for t-shirts + $200 designer + $45 samples = $1,095 total

### Primary Pain Points

#### 1. Design Quality Expectations vs. Reality
> "We're surrounded by designers and architects with very high aesthetic standards. The gap between what we expected and what template-based platforms could deliver was huge. I felt like I was letting the team down by not finding the right solution."

**Intensity Score:** 9/10

#### 2. Sample Ordering Adds Time and Cost
> "I understand why samples are necessary, but ordering from three vendors, waiting for them to arrive, evaluating quality, and socializing opinions added two weeks to the project. For a small order, that felt like overkill, but I couldn't risk getting it wrong."

**Intensity Score:** 6/10

#### 3. Inventory Management and Sizing
> "I'm not a retail buyer. I don't know how many smalls vs. mediums vs. larges to order. I end up over-ordering to avoid running out, which means we have leftover inventory that becomes my problem to store and eventually throw away."

**Intensity Score:** 7/10

#### 4. High Expectations with Limited Budget
> "Our budget is modest, but our expectations are high. I'm constantly trying to balance quality with cost, and it feels like most vendors force you to choose one or the other. I want both, and I'm willing to do the work to find it, but it's exhausting."

**Intensity Score:** 8/10

### Current Solutions and Workarounds

**Current Approach:** Hybrid model - external designer for concept, local print shop for production

**Why Local:** Quality control, ability to see/feel samples in person, support local business values

**Tradeoff:** Higher cost, less convenience, limited product selection

**Gap:** No platform that combines design quality, product quality, and reasonable pricing

### Concept Testing: Reaction to Branded Fit

When presented with the Branded Fit concept:

**Initial Reaction:**
> "The AI logo generation is interesting, but I'm skeptical about whether it can match the quality of a human designer, especially for a visually sophisticated brand like ours. But if the AI can generate options that meet our aesthetic bar, and we can refine them, that could work. The size self-selection feature is brilliant - that would eliminate so much guesswork on my part."

**Likelihood to Try:** 7/10

**Most Appealing Features:**
1. Employee size self-selection (eliminates guesswork and excess inventory)
2. Quality guarantees and product curation
3. Potential for design quality (pending seeing actual AI output)

**Concerns:**
> "I need to see the design AI in action before I'm convinced. We've tried 'AI design tools' before that produced garbage. Also, would we have the option to upload our own designs from our external designer if the AI doesn't meet our standards? Flexibility is important."

### Willingness to Pay

**Pricing Sensitivity:**
- **Monthly subscription:** Would pay **$150-$200/month** if it included design iterations and quality products
- **Per-order model:** Would accept **15-20% markup** for high-quality products and design support
- **Value justification:** "Honestly, the designer fee alone was $200 for this one project. If Branded Fit can eliminate that while maintaining quality, it pays for itself immediately."

**Purchase Decision Process:**
- **Decision maker:** David proposes vendors; managing partner has final approval for new vendor relationships
- **Evaluation criteria:** Design quality portfolio, product samples, references from design-forward companies
- **Timeline:** Would explore for next apparel need (likely Q2 2026)

### Key Quotes for Marketing

> "Design-forward companies have different expectations. We can't compromise on aesthetics just because we're a small business."

> "Every time I order branded merchandise, I feel like I'm disappointing the design team. I wish there was a solution that met our quality bar without requiring me to become a professional buyer."

## Interview 5: Rachel Thompson - Chief of Staff at Summit Financial Advisors

### Company Profile
- **Company:** Summit Financial Advisors
- **Size:** 48 employees (32 advisors, 16 support staff)
- **Industry:** Financial planning and wealth management
- **Location:** Charlotte, NC
- **Interviewee Role:** Chief of Staff (5 years in role)

### Background and Context

Rachel serves as the right hand to the CEO at Summit Financial, managing strategic projects, operations, and special initiatives. Branded merchandise falls under her scope as part of company culture and client relationship management. Summit Financial has grown significantly in recent years through advisor recruitment, making employee onboarding and brand consistency increasingly important.

**Current Merchandise Frequency:** 3-4 times per year
- New advisor welcome kits (ongoing)
- Annual advisor conference apparel
- Client appreciation gifts (2 times per year)
- Referral partner thank-you gifts (ongoing)

**Annual Budget:** Approximately $10,000

### Current Process and Workflow

Rachel described a complex recent project - creating differentiated welcome kits for new financial advisors vs. support staff in Q4 2025:

**Step 1: Stakeholder Alignment (3-4 hours)**
> "Unlike a marketing manager who can make unilateral decisions, I had to get buy-in from our CEO, our HR director, and our advisor council. Everyone had opinions on what should be included, what our brand should look like, and what message we were sending. That alignment process took multiple meetings."

**Step 2: Multi-Tier Product Selection (4-5 hours)**
> "We wanted to differentiate between advisor welcome kits and support staff welcome kits - advisors would get premium items to reflect their role and compensation level. That meant researching two separate product tiers. For advisors: premium quarter-zip pullovers, leather portfolios, and high-end drinkware. For support staff: t-shirts, standard portfolios, and standard drinkware."

**Step 3: Multiple Vendor Juggling (6-8 hours)**
> "Premium items aren't available from Custom Ink or Printful. I had to work with a promotional products distributor for the quarter-zips and leather goods, which required phone calls and email back-and-forth. For standard items, I used Custom Ink. Again, I'm managing two completely different vendor relationships with different processes."

**Step 4: Approval Bottlenecks (2 weeks)**
> "Our CEO is busy and hard to pin down. Getting him to review and approve designs took two weeks of back-and-forth. We'd send mockups, he'd suggest changes, we'd get new mockups from vendors, and repeat. The delay wasn't the vendor's fault - it was internal."

**Step 5: Budget Management (ongoing challenge)**
> "With two product tiers and two vendors, tracking costs against budget was complicated. I had to build a spreadsheet breaking down per-person costs for each tier, project annual needs based on hiring forecasts, and make sure we stayed within budget. It felt like a finance project."

**Total Time Investment:** 15-18 hours of active work + 2-3 weeks of waiting for approvals

**Total Cost:** $3,200 for initial batch + ongoing costs as new hires join

### Primary Pain Points

#### 1. Stakeholder Management Complexity
> "In a growing financial services firm, there are a lot of opinions and a lot of decision-makers. The merchandise itself is straightforward, but the internal process of getting alignment is painful. If I could present a polished, professional storefront with curated options and say 'pick from these,' it would streamline the approval process dramatically."

**Intensity Score:** 8/10

#### 2. Premium Product Sourcing
> "The DIY platforms like Custom Ink are great for basic t-shirts, but they don't have the premium products we need for client gifts and advisor onboarding. That forces me to work with traditional promotional products companies, which are stuck in 1995 with their technology and processes. It's painful."

**Intensity Score:** 9/10

#### 3. Scalability and Forecasting
> "We're hiring rapidly. I need a system that scales with us - where I can quickly onboard new hires with consistent branding and quality without having to recreate the process every time. Right now, every new hire batch feels like starting over."

**Intensity Score:** 7/10

#### 4. Brand Consistency Across Tiers
> "We have two product tiers, but we need one consistent brand identity. Making sure the logo looks identical on a $20 t-shirt and a $90 quarter-zip is harder than it sounds. Color matching across different materials and vendors is a real challenge."

**Intensity Score:** 7/10

### Current Solutions and Workarounds

**Current Vendors:**
- Custom Ink for basic apparel
- Promotional products distributor (PromoBrands) for premium items and leather goods
- Local embroidery shop for quarter-zips (quality concerns with PromoBrands)

**Design Management:** Work with a contract graphic designer ($500 retainer) for brand consistency

**Gap:** No single solution that spans basic to premium products with consistent brand management

### Concept Testing: Reaction to Branded Fit

When presented with the Branded Fit concept:

**Initial Reaction:**
> "This sounds like exactly what we need, but my first question is: does it support premium products? If Branded Fit is just another Custom Ink clone for cheap t-shirts, that's not helpful. But if you can handle everything from basic tees to premium quarter-zips to client gift items with one consistent brand and one streamlined process, you've solved our biggest problem."

**Likelihood to Try:** 8/10 (would be 10/10 if premium product range is confirmed)

**Most Appealing Features:**
1. Scalable solution for growing companies with consistent onboarding
2. Premium product availability (if available)
3. Centralized brand management across product tiers
4. Reduced stakeholder friction with polished storefront presentation

**Concerns:**
> "My biggest concern is customization flexibility. We need to differentiate between advisors and support staff, and potentially create custom kits for different occasions - new hires vs. anniversaries vs. client gifts. Can Branded Fit handle that level of customization, or is it a one-size-fits-all approach?"

### Willingness to Pay

**Pricing Sensitivity:**
- **Monthly subscription:** Would pay **$300-$400/month** for platform access, design support, and scalable ordering
- **Per-order model:** Would accept **8-12% markup** on products for consolidated vendor management and premium product access
- **Value justification:** "We spend $10,000 a year on merchandise. If Branded Fit saves me 60 hours annually and eliminates the need for a graphic design retainer ($500), that's $2,000-$3,000 in value. A $3,600/year subscription basically breaks even, and that's before factoring in potential cost savings from consolidated purchasing."

**Purchase Decision Process:**
- **Decision maker:** Rachel recommends; CEO approves vendors/contracts over $5,000 annually
- **Evaluation criteria:** Premium product portfolio, customization flexibility, brand consistency proofs, references from financial services firms
- **Timeline:** Would evaluate in Q1 2026 for implementation by Q2

### Key Quotes for Marketing

> "Growing companies need scalable solutions. I can't afford to spend 15 hours every time we hire a new advisor. I need a system that grows with us."

> "There's a massive gap in the market between DIY platforms for cheap swag and old-school promotional products distributors for premium items. Someone needs to bridge that gap with modern technology."

> "Internal stakeholder management is half the battle. If I can show executives a polished storefront instead of a spreadsheet of options, that speeds up decisions and makes me look more professional."

### Follow-up Opportunities

- **Beta testing interest:** ✅ Yes, very interested (pending premium product availability)
- **Referrals provided:** 2 contacts (HR directors at other financial services firms in Charlotte)
- **Product feedback:** Willing to provide ongoing feedback on premium product curation
- **Follow-up permission:** ✅ Yes, wants to stay informed on development timeline

### Beachhead Market Recommendation

Based on interview findings, we recommend targeting **Segment 1: Time-Starved Multi-Tasker** as our beachhead market for the following reasons:

2. **Highest pain point intensity:** Time investment creates urgent, visceral frustration
3. **Easiest to reach:** Active on LinkedIn, responsive to outreach, eager for solutions
4. **Clearest value proposition:** Time savings is easy to quantify and demonstrate
5. **Lower customization requirements:** Less complex feature requirements for MVP
6. **Fast decision-making:** Individual decision-makers with budget authority under $5K

**Secondary target:** Segment 2 (Brand-Conscious Perfectionist) should be next after establishing product-market fit with Segment 1, as they have higher willingness to pay and become strong advocates.

## Verbatim Customer Quotes (Organized by Theme)

### On Time Investment

> "Managing branded merchandise feels like a second job I didn't sign up for. It's not strategic, it's not creative - it's just time-consuming admin work." - Sarah Chen

> "I spend 60-80 hours a year on merchandise management. If this cuts that in half, it's worth $3,000-$4,000 annually just in my time savings." - Jennifer Patel

> "Time is money in a law firm. If this saves our attorneys from having to weigh in on logo placement and samples, that's billable hours saved." - Michael Rodriguez

> "Growing companies need scalable solutions. I can't afford to spend 15 hours every time we hire a new advisor." - Rachel Thompson

### On Design Quality

> "Every time I order company swag, I'm secretly terrified it'll show up looking cheap and reflect poorly on our brand." - Sarah Chen

> "I'm an operations guy, not a designer. I need tools that do the thinking for me so I can focus on running the firm." - Michael Rodriguez

> "I have literal nightmares about welcome kits arriving with mismatched logos. That's not an exaggeration." - Jennifer Patel

> "Design-forward companies have different expectations. We can't compromise on aesthetics just because we're a small business." - David Kim

### On Multi-Vendor Complexity

> "Juggling four different vendors for one project is exhausting. Four different accounts, four different design uploads, four different production timelines, four different shipping notifications. It's like having four part-time jobs just to give someone a welcome kit." - Jennifer Patel

> "Managing multiple vendors for a single project is like conducting an orchestra where none of the musicians can see you. It's chaos." - Jennifer Patel

> "There's a massive gap in the market between DIY platforms for cheap swag and old-school promotional products distributors for premium items. Someone needs to bridge that gap with modern technology." - Rachel Thompson

### On Vendor Research and Evaluation

> "There are so many options, and they all look the same on the surface. I have no idea how to evaluate quality without ordering samples. I wish someone would just tell me: here are three vetted vendors, here's what makes them different, pick one." - Sarah Chen

> "There's no Yelp for promotional products vendors. I had no idea if I was getting ripped off or if the quality would be good. I just had to trust this random company I found on Google." - Michael Rodriguez

### On Size Collection

> "If someone could wave a magic wand and make the size collection process disappear, I'd pay good money for that wand." - Sarah Chen

> "Collecting sizes is like herding cats. People don't respond to emails, they ask for sizing advice I can't give, and there's always someone who needs a size exchange after the fact." - Sarah Chen

> "I'm not a retail buyer. I don't know how many smalls vs. mediums vs. larges to order. I end up over-ordering to avoid running out, which means we have leftover inventory." - David Kim

### On Lack of Visibility and Communication

> "The worst part of ordering branded merchandise is the black box. I place an order and just have to pray it shows up on time and looks good." - Michael Rodriguez

> "Once I placed the order, I had zero visibility into production status. I was emailing the vendor every few days asking 'Where are we at?' and getting vague responses." - Michael Rodriguez

### On Value and Willingness to Pay

> "If this saved me 8 hours per order and I do 4 orders a year, that's 40 hours - basically a full work week. That's easily worth $1,000-$1,200 annually, maybe more." - Sarah Chen

> "Honestly, the designer fee alone was $200 for this one project. If Branded Fit can eliminate that while maintaining quality, it pays for itself immediately." - David Kim

> "If you can solve the multi-vendor coordination problem, you've solved 80% of my branded merchandise headaches." - Jennifer Patel

**Key Takeaways:**

1. ✅ **Problem is validated:** 100% of interviewees confirmed branded merchandise procurement is time-consuming and frustrating
2. ✅ **Willingness to pay exists:** 80% expressed strong purchase intent at $200-$400/month or 10-15% markup
