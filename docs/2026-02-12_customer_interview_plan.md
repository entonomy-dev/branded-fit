# Customer Interview Guide and Recruitment Plan
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Project:** Branded Fit - Primary Market Research (Disciplined Entrepreneurship Step 1)
**Author:** Head of Sales & Customer Development

## Executive Summary

This customer interview plan provides a structured framework for validating Branded Fit's core assumptions about small business marketing managers' pain points regarding branded merchandise procurement. Our primary objective is to conduct discovery interviews with 5+ marketing managers at small businesses (10-100 employees) to understand their current processes, identify pain points, validate the need for automated merchandise creation using brand logos, and assess willingness to pay for such a solution.

The plan includes 18 carefully crafted interview questions designed to uncover: current procurement workflows, decision-making criteria, budget constraints, vendor relationships, pain points with existing solutions, and receptivity to AI-powered merchandise automation. Our recruitment strategy targets marketing managers in key industries through LinkedIn outreach, small business associations, and professional networks, with a goal of completing all interviews within 3 weeks.

Based on B2B customer discovery best practices, interviews will follow a 90% listening, 10% talking ratio, using open-ended questions aligned with "The Mom Test" principles - focusing on past behavior rather than hypothetical futures, and avoiding solution pitching during discovery.

Key success metrics include: conducting 5+ substantive interviews, identifying 3+ validated pain points, achieving 80% interview completion rate, and gathering quantitative data on pricing expectations and current spending levels.

## Interview Objectives Aligned with Disciplined Entrepreneurship Step 1

### Primary Objectives
1. **Validate Market Pain Points**: Confirm that small business marketing managers experience significant friction in the branded merchandise ordering process
2. **Understand Current Solutions**: Map the existing workflow, tools, and vendors used for creating and ordering promotional products
3. **Assess Decision Criteria**: Identify what factors drive purchasing decisions (quality, speed, cost, ease-of-use, customization options)
4. **Quantify Willingness to Pay**: Establish baseline pricing expectations and budget ranges for merchandise automation solutions
5. **Identify Purchasing Patterns**: Understand frequency, volume, and seasonality of branded merchandise orders
6. **Explore Unmet Needs**: Discover latent pain points that customers may not explicitly articulate

### Secondary Objectives
1. Identify key stakeholders in the purchasing process
2. Understand competitive landscape from customer perspective
3. Gauge receptivity to AI-powered design automation
4. Identify potential early adopters for beta testing
5. Validate or refute assumptions about target customer segment

### Interview Facilitation Best Practices

**DO:**
- Ask one question at a time (avoid compound questions)
- Embrace awkward silence - let them think and fill the space
- Follow up with "Why?" and "Tell me more about that"
- Focus on past behavior and specific examples, not hypothetical futures
- Ask for specific stories: "Tell me about the last time..."
- Take notes on direct quotes (use their exact words)
- Watch for body language cues and emotional reactions
- Validate their feelings ("That sounds frustrating")
- Drill down with multiple layers of "why" to reach root causes

**DON'T:**
- Pitch your product or solution (this is discovery, not sales)
- Ask leading questions ("Wouldn't it be great if...")
- Ask yes/no questions - rephrase to open-ended
- Interrupt when they're on a roll
- Mention specific features before understanding their complete process
- Argue or defend current solutions
- Rush through questions - let them talk
- Fill every silence with your own words
- Accept vague generalizations - probe for specifics

- Competitive intelligence: Learn what customers actually use and why

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: Low response rate to outreach**
- *Mitigation:* Diversify recruitment channels, offer higher incentives ($75 instead of $50), leverage warm introductions, add personal video messages in outreach
- *Backup plan:* Extend recruitment period by 1 week, use paid recruiting platforms

**Challenge 2: Interviewees not in target market**
- *Mitigation:* Use qualifying questions in initial outreach ("Have you ordered branded merchandise in the past 12 months?"), confirm company size and role before scheduling
- *Backup plan:* Conduct interviews anyway to gather broader insights, may reveal new segments

**Challenge 3: Interviews lack depth or specifics**
- *Mitigation:* Prepare better probing questions, create comfortable rapport early, extend interview time if participant is engaged, use multi-layer "why" drilling technique
- *Backup plan:* Schedule brief follow-up calls for additional questions, send email with 2-3 clarifying questions

**Challenge 4: Scheduling conflicts and cancellations**
- *Mitigation:* Over-schedule interviews (plan for 20% cancellation rate), offer maximum flexibility including early morning/evening slots, send 24-hour reminders
- *Backup plan:* Have waitlist of interested participants, offer to reschedule at their convenience

## Interview Analysis Framework

After each interview, document:
1. **Company Profile:** Size, industry, location, annual revenue (if shared)
2. **Interviewee Profile:** Role, tenure, responsibilities
3. **Key Pain Points:** Ranked by severity (critical, major, minor)

6. **Compelling Quotes:** Verbatim statements about pain points and needs
7. **Solution Fit Score:** 1-10 rating of how well Branded Fit addresses their needs
8. **Follow-up Actions:** Potential beta tester, referral source, feature requests

### Cross-Interview Pattern Analysis

- **Pricing Consensus:** What pricing model and range has the most support?
- **Feature Priorities:** Which features are "must-haves" vs. "nice-to-haves"?
- **Competitive Insights:** Which competitors are mentioned most often?

## Next Steps After Interview Completion

2. **Validate Market Opportunity:** Use interview data to size and qualify the target market
3. **Refine Value Proposition:** Adjust messaging based on customer language and priorities

## Appendix A: Interview Best Practices (Evidence-Based)

### The Foundation: Customer Development Interview Principles

Based on customer discovery research best practices, effective B2B customer development interviews follow these evidence-based principles:

**1. The 90/10 Listening Ratio**
The best interviews are 90% listening and 10% talking. Practice active listening to truly understand their challenges, goals, and expectations.

**2. The Mom Test Approach**
Focus on past behavior rather than hypothetical futures. Ask about what they've actually done, not what they say they might do. Keep things factual and get them to tell stories about how they previously experienced problems.

**3. Semi-Structured Interview Guide**
Have a plan and follow an interview script to gather consistent data points across all prospects. It's okay to adjust phrasing or add questions, but being able to compare interviews is critical.

**4. Open-Ended, Behavior-Focused Questions**
Start with broad questions that allow the interviewee to share in-depth responses. Ask "Tell me how you manage [specific task]" rather than "Do you struggle with [task]?"

**5. Multi-Layer "Why" Drilling**
Always follow up with open-ended questions like "why?" or "tell me more about that experience." Drill into multiple layers of "why" to understand root causes, not just surface symptoms.

**6. Sample Size for Pattern Recognition**
Run interviews with at least 5-8 customers per target segment to identify consistent patterns and validate insights across multiple data points.

### Do's
- Start with rapport-building questions about their role and company
- Listen more than you talk (90/10 rule, not 80/20)
- Ask open-ended questions and follow "why" down to root causes
- Request specific examples and stories ("Tell me about the last time...")
- Validate understanding by summarizing what you heard
- Take detailed notes or record (with permission)
- End by asking for referrals to similar professionals
- Ask short, open-ended questions and resist the urge to pitch your product
- Watch body language and expressions closely (if video call)
- Create a comfortable and professional atmosphere

### Don'ts
- Don't pitch your solution (this is discovery, not sales)
- Don't lead the witness with your assumptions ("Wouldn't it be great if...")
- Don't skip uncomfortable questions about budget and willingness to pay
- Don't accept vague generalities - probe for specifics
- Don't debate or defend existing solutions
- Don't rush - let silence create space for deeper reflection
- Don't forget to send thank-you notes and incentives within 24-48 hours
- Don't ask closed-ended "yes/no" questions (can result in confirmation bias)
- Don't interview in groups - meet one prospect at a time to surface personal pains
