## Deliverables & Documents

All research, reports, plans, and documents MUST be saved in the
`docs/` directory with a date prefix (YYYY-MM-DD) for future reference:

  docs/2026-02-12_market_research.md
  docs/2026-02-12_technical_feasibility.md
  docs/2026-02-12_competitor_analysis.md

Always include the date prefix so future agents know when the document
was created.

**Commit and push all deliverables to the GitHub repository.**
Use `git add docs/ && git commit -m 'Add <description>' && git push`
after creating or updating documents.

Files are also synced to S3 automatically after execution.
