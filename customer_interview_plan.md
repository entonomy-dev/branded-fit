## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive customer discovery plan for Branded Fit, focusing on validating critical assumptions about customer pain points, current solutions, and willingness to adopt an automated corporate apparel solution. Based on extensive market research conducted in February 2026, we have identified significant pain points in the corporate merchandise space that Branded Fit is positioned to address.

**Key Market Insights:**
- Corporate swag organizers spend an average of **10 hours per week** on merchandise management tasks outside their official job descriptions
- **60%** of swag organizers are managing these responsibilities without formal role designation
- **29%** report feeling very or extremely anxious about orders arriving late or wrong
- Marketing budgets have dropped to **7.7%** of company revenue, requiring maximum efficiency
- **67%** only consider swag investments successful if recipients voluntarily use items
- Average B2B buying group has grown to **10-11 stakeholders**, with **79%** requiring CFO approval

This plan targets marketing managers and operations personnel at small businesses (10-100 employees) who currently manage branded apparel procurement manually. Our goal is to validate whether Branded Fit's automated solution addresses genuine pain points worth $3,000-10,000 annually per customer.
