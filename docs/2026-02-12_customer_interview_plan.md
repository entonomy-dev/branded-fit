## Executive Summary

This customer interview plan provides a structured framework for validating Branded Fit's core assumptions about small business marketing managers' pain points regarding branded merchandise procurement. Our primary objective is to conduct discovery interviews with 5+ marketing managers at small businesses (10-100 employees) to understand their current processes, identify pain points, validate the need for automated merchandise creation using brand logos, and assess willingness to pay for such a solution.

Key success metrics include: conducting 5+ substantive interviews, identifying 3+ validated pain points, achieving 80% interview completion rate, and gathering quantitative data on pricing expectations and current spending levels.
