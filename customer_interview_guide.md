## 7. Interview Best Practices

### Do's
- **Do** listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- **Do** ask open-ended questions ("Tell me about..." "Walk me through...")
- **Do** probe for specific examples and stories
- **Do** stay curious and avoid leading questions
- **Do** take detailed notes on exact quotes and emotional reactions
- **Do** validate their experiences and frustrations
- **Do** ask "why" to get to root causes
- **Do** leave space for silence—sometimes the best insights come after a pause

### Don'ts
- **Don't** pitch your solution too early
- **Don't** lead the witness with questions like "Wouldn't you love a solution that..."
- **Don't** get defensive if they criticize your concept
- **Don't** multitask or appear distracted during the interview
- **Don't** overschedule—leave time between interviews to synthesize notes
- **Don't** assume you understand their problem—let them explain fully
- **Don't** skip the "ask for referrals" step

### Key Interviewing Techniques

**The Five Whys**
When you hear a pain point or behavior, ask "why" multiple times to get to root cause.
- "We always order apparel at the last minute."
- "Why is that?"
- "Because we don't plan ahead for events."
- "Why don't you plan ahead?"
- "Because we don't have visibility into our event calendar."
- "Why not?"
- "Because different departments manage their own events independently."

**Moment of Truth Questions**
Focus on specific moments of decision or frustration:
- "Tell me about the moment you decided to order branded apparel."
- "What was going through your mind when you saw the quote?"
- "How did you feel when the order arrived late?"

**Hypothetical Scenario Testing**
Test solution concepts without pitching:
- "Imagine you could wave a magic wand and fix this process. What would the ideal experience look like?"
- "If you had an extra 10 hours per month, what would you do with that time?"

## Appendix A: Interview Recording and Confidentiality

### Recording Policy
- Request permission at the beginning of each interview
- Explain that recording is for note-taking accuracy only
- Offer option to decline recording (still conduct interview with written notes)
- Store recordings securely and delete after transcription

### Confidentiality Assurance
"Everything you share today will be kept confidential. We're synthesizing insights across multiple interviews to understand common patterns, not attributing specific comments to individuals or companies. If we want to quote you directly in any materials, we'll reach out for explicit permission first."

---

## Appendix B: Common Interview Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Interviewee Gives Short, Surface-Level Answers
**Solution:** Use follow-up probes
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "Walk me through a specific example."
- "What made that frustrating for you?"

### Challenge: Interview Goes Off Track
**Solution:** Gently redirect
- "That's really interesting. Let me make sure I capture that, and then I want to go back to..."
- "I want to be respectful of your time. Can we shift back to..."

### Challenge: Interviewee Asks You Questions
**Solution:** Defer until the end
- "That's a great question. I want to make sure I have time to hear your experience first. Can I answer that at the end of our conversation?"

### Challenge: Interviewee Hasn't Ordered Apparel Recently
**Solution:** Explore reasons why
- "What's prevented you from ordering branded apparel?"
- "Is this something you've considered but decided against?"
- "If you were to order branded apparel, what would the process look like?"
