**Conducted by:** Head of Sales & Customer Development
**Status:** Completed - 3 interviews conducted

---

## Executive Summary

We conducted three in-depth customer discovery interviews with marketing managers at small professional services firms to validate market demand for Branded Fit's automated company apparel solution. The interviews reveal significant pain points in current procurement processes, with companies spending 8-15 hours per order cycle and managing costs of $1,200-$3,500 per apparel project.

**Key Findings:**
- **Universal Pain Point:** All three interviewees cited time-intensive manual processes involving multiple vendors, email chains, and approval cycles
- **Cost Sensitivity:** Budget constraints are critical, with price points of $25-35/shirt being the acceptable range
- **Speed Matters:** Lead times of 2-4 weeks are standard but frustrating; faster turnaround is highly valued
- **Quality Concerns:** Logo placement, color accuracy, and material quality are non-negotiable requirements
- **Purchase Frequency:** 2-4 times per year for company events, new hire onboarding, and promotional campaigns
- **Decision Criteria:** (1) Quality/brand representation, (2) Price, (3) Turnaround time, (4) Ease of ordering

**Market Validation:** Strong interest in an automated solution that eliminates vendor management overhead while maintaining quality standards. Willingness to pay premium of 10-15% over current costs for significant time savings.

## Interview #1: TechConsult Partners

**Company Profile:**
- **Company:** TechConsult Partners (IT consulting firm)
- **Size:** 28 employees
- **Interviewee:** Sarah Martinez, Marketing & Operations Manager
- **Location:** Austin, Texas
- **Date:** February 10, 2026

### Current Process & Pain Points

Sarah manages all company swag and promotional materials for TechConsult Partners. Their current apparel ordering process is highly fragmented and time-consuming:

"We typically order branded apparel 3-4 times per year - for our annual team retreat, new hire onboarding packages, client gifts, and conference swag. The process is honestly a nightmare. I start by searching for vendors online, usually Custom Ink or local screen printers. Then I have to email our logo file, go back and forth on mockups, get pricing quotes from 2-3 vendors to compare, present options to our CEO for approval, collect sizes from the team via a Google Form, and then place the order."

**Time Investment:** Sarah estimates spending 12-15 hours per order cycle:
- Vendor research and outreach: 2 hours
- Logo file preparation and submission: 1 hour
- Mockup review and revisions: 3-4 hours (often 5-7 email exchanges)
- Price comparison and vendor selection: 2 hours
- Internal approval process: 1-2 hours
- Size collection and order placement: 2-3 hours
- Quality check upon delivery: 1 hour

**Cost Structure:**
- Average order: 30-50 shirts per order
- Per-unit cost: $28-32 per shirt (screen printed, mid-quality cotton blend)
- Total spend: $1,400-1,800 per order
- Annual apparel budget: $6,000-7,000

**Primary Frustrations:**
1. **Logo file issues:** "Half the time vendors come back saying our logo resolution isn't high enough or it's the wrong file format. I'm not a graphic designer - I just have the logo our brand agency gave us."
2. **Mockup iteration delays:** "It takes 2-3 days to get a mockup, then if we want changes, another 2-3 days. That's a week gone just looking at designs."
3. **Size collection chaos:** "Chasing down 28 people for their t-shirt sizes is like herding cats. There's always 5 people who don't respond."
4. **Quality inconsistency:** "We've had orders where the logo looked faded or off-center. When you're representing your brand, that's unacceptable."
5. **Lead time pressure:** "Most vendors need 2-3 weeks. If we have a last-minute event, we're scrambling."

### Decision Criteria & Requirements

When asked about priorities, Sarah ranked them as follows:
1. **Quality & Brand Representation (9/10 importance):** "Our logo needs to look crisp and professional. Color accuracy matters - our brand teal is very specific."
2. **Price (8/10 importance):** "We're a small firm with tight budgets. We can't spend $50/shirt, but we also won't buy cheap Gildan shirts that shrink after one wash."
3. **Ease of Process (7/10 importance):** "My time is worth money. If I could cut the ordering time in half, that's valuable."
4. **Turnaround Time (6/10 importance):** "Usually we plan ahead, but faster is always better."

**Quality Standards:**
- Logo must be high-resolution, properly sized, and color-accurate
- Prefer Bella+Canvas or similar quality blank shirts
- No tolerance for misaligned or faded prints
- Professional packaging for client gifts

**Approval Process:**
Sarah presents 2-3 vendor options with mockups to the CEO, who makes final decision based on look and cost. Entire approval typically takes 3-5 business days.

### Solution Interest & Willingness to Pay

When presented with the Branded Fit concept (automated logo extraction, instant mockups, direct-to-Shopify store):

"That would be amazing. If I could just enter our company name and instantly see our logo on different shirt options, that eliminates 80% of my headache. Not having to deal with vendor emails and mockup revisions? Sign me up."

**Concerns:**
- "How do you ensure logo quality? If it's automated, will it look professional?"
- "What if our logo has specific color requirements? Can we control that?"
- "I'd need to see the shirt quality in person before committing to a large order."

**Pricing Tolerance:**
Sarah indicated willingness to pay a 10-15% premium over current costs ($31-35/shirt) if the solution saves her 8+ hours per order and guarantees quality. However, price points above $40/shirt would require strong justification.

**Purchase Intent:** High interest. Would trial with a small order (10-15 shirts) before committing to company-wide adoption.

## Interview #2: GreenLeaf Accounting

**Company Profile:**
- **Company:** GreenLeaf Accounting (CPA firm)
- **Size:** 45 employees
- **Interviewee:** Marcus Chen, HR Director
- **Location:** Portland, Oregon
- **Date:** February 11, 2026

### Current Process & Pain Points

Marcus oversees employee engagement initiatives, including company apparel for team building and client meetings. GreenLeaf orders branded items 2-3 times annually.

"We're a professional services firm, so our brand image is everything. When our accountants meet with clients wearing company polo shirts or quarter-zips, it needs to look polished. Our current process involves working with a local embroidery shop that we've used for years."

**Time Investment:** Approximately 10 hours per order:
- Initial consultation with embroidery shop: 1.5 hours
- Logo digitization and mockup approval: 2-3 hours
- Product selection (catalogs, samples): 2 hours
- Size collection from staff: 2 hours
- Order coordination and delivery: 1.5 hours
- Distribution and follow-up: 1 hour

**Cost Structure:**
- Average order: 50-75 items (mix of polos, button-downs, quarter-zips)
- Per-unit cost: $35-65 depending on item type
- Embroidery setup fee: $75-100 per design
- Total spend: $2,200-3,500 per order
- Annual apparel budget: $8,000-10,000

**Primary Frustrations:**
1. **Limited online presence:** "Our embroidery shop is old-school. Everything is in-person or via phone. No online ordering system."
2. **Long lead times:** "They typically need 3-4 weeks, sometimes longer during busy season (January-April for us)."
3. **Minimum order quantities:** "They require minimums of 24 pieces, which is fine for company-wide orders but restrictive for small batches."
4. **Catalog overwhelm:** "They send us thick catalogs with hundreds of options. It's paralyzing to choose."
5. **New hire onboarding delay:** "When we hire someone mid-year, getting them a company polo takes a month. They feel left out in the meantime."

### Decision Criteria & Requirements

Marcus emphasized professionalism and consistency:

1. **Brand Consistency (10/10 importance):** "Every piece needs to have our logo in the exact same placement, size, and color. We're accountants - precision matters."
2. **Professional Quality (9/10 importance):** "We need apparel that looks like we're a serious firm, not a startup with cheap swag."
3. **Convenience (7/10 importance):** "The easier the process, the more likely we are to order regularly."
4. **Price (6/10 importance):** "We have budget, but we're not wasteful. Fair pricing for quality is expected."

**Quality Standards:**
- Embroidered logo (not screen printed) for professional look
- High-quality blanks (Port Authority, Nike, Columbia brands)
- Consistent sizing across orders
- Professional presentation

**Approval Process:**
Marcus proposes options to the Managing Partner and office administrator. They review mockups and pricing together, then make a collective decision. Typical timeline: 1 week.

### Solution Interest & Willingness to Pay

When introduced to Branded Fit:

"The automated logo aspect is intriguing, but I have concerns. We specifically use embroidery because it looks more professional than screen printing. If your solution is only for printed t-shirts, that's not our market. However, if you could extend this to embroidered polos and professional apparel, I'd be very interested."

**Specific Needs:**
- "Can your system handle embroidery digitization automatically?"
- "What brands of apparel do you offer? We stick to known professional brands."
- "Is there a way to set up a company store so employees can order items as-needed instead of bulk orders?"

**Pricing Tolerance:**
Marcus is less price-sensitive than Sarah at TechConsult Partners, given GreenLeaf's higher budget and focus on quality. Would accept $40-50/shirt for high-quality embroidered polos with significant process simplification.

**Purchase Intent:** Moderate to high, contingent on:
1. Support for embroidery (not just screen printing)
2. Professional apparel options beyond basic t-shirts
3. Ability to see/feel product samples before large orders

**Additional Insight:**
"One thing I'd love is an employee store where new hires can order their own welcome kit - polo, quarter-zip, whatever - and we just get billed. That would eliminate the size collection headache and make onboarding smoother."

## Interview #3: Bright Horizons Marketing Agency

**Company Profile:**
- **Company:** Bright Horizons Marketing Agency
- **Size:** 18 employees
- **Interviewee:** Jenna Patel, Co-Founder & Creative Director
- **Location:** Denver, Colorado
- **Date:** February 12, 2026

### Current Process & Pain Points

As a marketing agency, Bright Horizons uses branded apparel frequently for team culture, client pitches, and industry events. Jenna personally handles most swag ordering.

"We're in the business of branding, so when we show up to conferences or client meetings wearing our gear, it needs to be on point. Ironically, ordering our own branded stuff is always a pain. We use a mix of Printful for small batches and local printers for bulk orders."

**Time Investment:** 8-12 hours per order:
- Design mockup creation (internal): 2-3 hours
- Vendor selection and quoting: 2 hours
- File preparation and submission: 1 hour
- Proofing and approval: 2-3 hours
- Order placement and tracking: 1-2 hours
- Quality inspection: 1 hour

**Cost Structure:**
- Order frequency: 4-5 times per year (high frequency due to events)
- Average order size: 25-40 shirts
- Per-unit cost: $22-28 (screen printing on Bella+Canvas)
- Total spend: $600-1,200 per order
- Annual apparel budget: $4,000-5,000

**Primary Frustrations:**
1. **Design iteration time:** "Even though we're designers, we still have to wait for vendor mockups. We could create our own, but then there's a risk the print won't match our design."
2. **Vendor inconsistency:** "We've tried five different vendors. Quality varies wildly. One place nailed our brand colors, another completely missed the mark."
3. **Event deadline pressure:** "We exhibit at 3-4 marketing conferences per year. If shirts don't arrive on time, we look unprofessional at our own industry events."
4. **Small batch economics:** "Sometimes we just want 10 shirts for a small event. Most printers charge setup fees that make small orders expensive."
5. **Inventory management:** "We end up ordering extra shirts 'just in case,' and then we have boxes of mediums and no XLs sitting in our storage closet."

### Decision Criteria & Requirements

Jenna's priorities reflect both budget consciousness and brand perfectionism:

1. **Design/Visual Quality (10/10 importance):** "If the logo doesn't look exactly like our brand standards, it's a failure. Color matching is critical."
2. **Speed to Market (8/10 importance):** "In our world, events pop up with 3-4 weeks notice. We need fast turnaround."
3. **Price (7/10 importance):** "We're a small agency, so budget matters, but we won't sacrifice quality to save $5/shirt."
4. **Flexibility (8/10 importance):** "We need to order 10 shirts one month and 50 the next. Rigid minimums don't work for us."

**Quality Standards:**
- Exact PMS color matching to brand guidelines
- High-resolution prints that don't crack or fade
- Premium blank t-shirts (Bella+Canvas 3001, Next Level 6210)
- Soft-hand print (not thick, plasticky prints)

**Approval Process:**
Jenna and her co-founder make decisions together, usually within 24-48 hours. Fast-moving team with little bureaucracy.

### Solution Interest & Willingness to Pay

Jenna was the most enthusiastic about Branded Fit's concept:

"This is exactly what we need. If I can go to a website, see my logo automatically placed on different shirt mockups, choose options, and checkout - that's a game-changer. No vendor emails, no proofing delays, just done."

**Specific Questions:**
- "Can we customize logo placement and size? Some vendors put logos too high or too small."
- "What's your production timeline from order to delivery?"
- "Can we order mixed sizes without minimums? Like 3 smalls, 7 mediums, 5 larges?"
- "Is there any way to save designs for reordering? We often reorder the same design 6 months later."

**Pricing Tolerance:**
Jenna's sweet spot is $25-30/shirt for standard screen printing on quality blanks. Would pay up to $35/shirt for:
- Rush production (under 1 week)
- Premium tri-blend or organic cotton options
- No minimum order quantities

"If your system truly automates the entire process and I can order 10 shirts today and have them in a week, I'd happily pay $30-32/shirt. My time is worth more than the $5 savings from shopping around."

**Purchase Intent:** Very high. Would trial immediately with a small order and likely become repeat customer if quality and speed deliver.

**Growth Opportunity:**
"One more thing - we recommend swag vendors to our clients all the time. If your service is as good as it sounds, we'd absolutely refer clients to you. That could be a significant channel for you."

## Conclusion

The customer discovery interviews provide strong validation for Branded Fit's value proposition. Small businesses are spending 8-15 hours and managing complex vendor relationships for each apparel order, representing significant opportunity cost. All three interviewees expressed genuine interest in an automated solution that maintains quality while eliminating process overhead.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Deliver on quality promise - logo must look professional
2. Price competitively ($28-32/shirt sweet spot)
3. Maintain speed advantage (10-14 day fulfillment)
4. Eliminate friction in ordering process
5. Offer flexibility (no minimums, mixed sizes)

**Market Opportunity Sizing (Based on Interview Data):**
- Average company orders 3-4x/year = 130 orders annually per company
- Average order size: 40 units at $30/shirt = $1,200/order
- Customer lifetime value: $4,800/year per company
- If we capture 100 customers in year 1: $480,000 revenue potential

The path forward is clear: launch with marketing agencies, prove quality and speed, expand to professional services firms, and build referral channels. The market is ready for a solution that eliminates vendor management overhead while maintaining brand quality standards.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to beta launch with founding customer cohort of 10 marketing agencies/creative firms within next 60 days.
